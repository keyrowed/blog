Hello!

This is the repository for my personal blog. I want to have a little more extra control for a personal touch, so I've decided to fully build a Zola site from scratch, including both content and theming. That's why it'll be perpertually work-in-progress!

**Note**: As this is a personal project, I currently do not intend to accept any pull requests. However, if something is wrong, feel free to submit an issue instead!
