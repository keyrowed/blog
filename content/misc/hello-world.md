This is the first post (of hopefully many) on this blog! As a little introduction, here's why and how I made the blog.

# Why?

I made this blog to document whatever endevours I want to take up, including the development of this blog.

I also want to pass some recognition to [Daudix](https://daudix.one/) and [fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/) as their blogs did contribute to me desiring my own.

# How?

As I intend for this blog to primarily contain static content, I decided to use a static site generator for creating this blog, namely [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). It was a toss-up between Hugo and Zola, but I decided to go with Zola in the end due to my preference of [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) over [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

Although I'm using a static site generator, I will be theming the site from scratch because I think it'll make for a fun experience (despite having zero webdev or UI/UX design experience) :D
