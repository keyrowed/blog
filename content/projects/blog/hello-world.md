Hello! This is the first post of a series where I document the creation of this blog. It's also the first post on this blog as a whole!

I made this blog as to serve as a platform for documenting whatever I want, which I can roughly categorize into:
- Thoughts - Ideas which may or may not be acted upon.
- Projects - Documenting the creation of actual usable stuff.
- Misc - Everything else.

This blog was created with Zola, but the slight twist is that I'll be theming the whole site from scratch. That's why the site will probably look like a work-in-progress for a good while. Behind the scenes, I'm also trying to use [jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) as the VCS tool of choice because it looks fun :D

### Acknowledgments

I would like to give some credit to a few sites which gave me a push to create my own:
- [fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me/)
- [daudix.one](https://daudix.one/)
- [skylosblog.com](https://skylosblog.com/)
